<title>Comparison of Relative Energies and Powers</title>
</head>

<h2 align="center">Comparison of Relative Energies and Powers</h2>
<p>A lot of times, you can evaluate a statement or theory by just looking to see 
if the energy and power involved are reasonable. To help you out, here is a list 
of the energy and power (rate of energy) for some common and not-so-common 
things. There has been a lot of judicious rounding and estimation in this table, 
so don't use it for precise quantitative work. Use it to verify stories and 
claims to an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>The energy is given in the standard SI unit of Joules. A Joule is the same as 
a newton meter. Mechanical energy is usually given in Nm, and electrical and 
heat is usually given in Joules, but they are really the same unit. A watt is 
one Joule in one second, or to put it another way, a Joule is a watt-second. For 
comparison, a Joule is about .74 Foot Pound. A horsepower is 550 ftlb/second or 
745 watts.</p>
<p>1 Newton Meter = 1 Joule = &nbsp;.74 FtLb</p>
<p>I have included some discussions of notorious, and inaccurate, comparisons. 
These are designed to show that mere comparisons of energy aren't necessarily 
significant, and that a little qualitative analysis helps to separate the 
marketing hype from reasonable facts.</p>

<h4><a name="GasDynamite">The nonsense about gasoline and dynamite</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;A lot of times, it is the rate at which the energy is transferred or 
released that is more important than the amount of energy. There is an often 
repeated statement that a cup of gasoline is the same as 16 sticks of dynamite. 
Are they talking about the energy or the power (rate of release)? First off, 
energy probably isn't an appropriate comparison. After all, the energy in that 
cup of gas (around 8MJ) is the same as the energy in about a pound and a quarter 
of wood, which clearly isn't really comparable. Anyway, on an energy basis, the 
cup is more like 4 pounds worth of high explosive(8 MJ for the cup of gas, 2 MJ 
for the pound of HE).</p>
<p>More significant though, is that the explosive releases all of the energy in 
around 4 microseconds: a rate of 2000 GigaWatts. The gas-air mixture takes 2 or 
3 milliseconds to explode (the combustion wave is limited to the speed of 
sound), for a power of around 3 GW. And of course, the wood takes several 
minutes to burn, for a power of around 30 kW. </p>
<p>For an interesting exercise compare this to a small nuclear explosion of 20 
kilotons (= 80 Tera Joules = 8E13 Joules), where virtually all the energy 
release takes place in about a microsecond for a power of almost 10 to the 19 
watts. 80 TJ is a bunch of energy (about what a 1000 MW power plant puts out in 
a day), but it is the phenomenally high rate that makes nuclear explosives 
really different.</p>
<h5>Calculation background:</h5>
<p>Gasoline has an combustion energy of about 47.4 MJ/kg, so a simple 
calculation will show that the cup (170g) will release about 8MJ when burned. 
When vaporized and mixed with air at the optimum ratio (stoichiometric), the 
mixture will occupy about 2100 liters, or a sphere some 0.80 m in radius. 
Assuming the mixture is ignited at the center of the sphere, it will take about 
2.5 milliseconds for the flame front to propagate to the outer edge. This makes 
the assumptions that the flame front moves at the speed of sound (probably 
reasonable), and that the sphere of mixture doesn't expand appreciably due to 
the heating in the middle (probably very optimistic). So, 8 MJ in .0025 seconds 
is 3200 MW, or 3.2 GW</p>
<p>The detonation wave in most high explosives moves at around 4500 m/sec, 
substantially above the speed of sound (which is what makes it a detonation, and 
not just burning fast). That 4 pounds of explosive would be a cylinder about 5 
cm in diameter and 20 cm long. At 4500 m/sec, it takes about 4 microseconds for 
the detonation wave to move through the entire amount. 8 MJ in 4 microseconds is 
2000 GW.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<a name="regen">Regenerative braking is a marketing ploy</a></h4>
<p>Another interesting observation has to do with the energy required to 
accelerate and run a car down the road. Much has been made of the ability to do 
regenerative braking with electric cars; that is, as you slow down the kinetic 
energy of the car is used to charge the batteries. For cars that run on the 
freeway, though, this is almost insignificant. The kinetic energy stored in the 
car moving at 60 mi/hr is about 500 kJ. That is the same energy it takes to go 
about a quarter of a mile (mostly overcoming air drag). Given the difficulty of 
doing regenerative braking for negligible increased range, you can see that 
regenerative braking is mostly a marketing ploy.</p>
<p>The problem with regenerative braking is that you have to charge the 
batteries at a very high rate (much higher than the normal discharge rate) which 
makes them hot and have shorter lives. Also, the motor in the car, acting as a 
generator during regenerative braking, has to be big enough to handle the power. 
Our hypothetical car may only require a 10 kW motor to accelerate and drive 
around, but would require a 180 kW generator to decelerate at 1 G. Since the 
size, weight, and price of electric motors/generators runs as a linear function 
of capacity, you can see that regenerative braking costs a lot, but doesn't buy 
you much in range.</p>
<p>These same little facts apply to any scheme where you are planning on saving 
the energy in the vehicle, whether you are using batteries or flywheels or fuel 
cells, or whatever. You still need a big motor/generator, etc. There are 
applications which are limited to very low speeds where aerodynamic drag is 
insignificant, and the maximum deceleration is limited, like urban transit 
buses. In these applications, regenerative braking does work, just not for cars 
on the freeway.</p>
<p>Another interesting automotive calculation is the idea of covering your car 
with solar cells. As a rough approximation, the average power of the sun falling 
on a flat surface is about 1kw/square meter. If your car was 4 meters long and 2 
meters wide, you'd be collecting 12 kW (best possible scenario with perfect 
solar cells) (about 16 HP). With real solar cells (10% efficiency), and taking 
into account the sun being at an angle, you're looking at around a kilowatt 
(just over a horsepower), which might just move your moped around town, but 
certainly not a car on the freeway. The power requirement goes up as the cube of 
the airspeed, so doubling your speed takes 8 times the kW (or HP).</p>
<p><a href="#Table"><em>(back to the table)</em></a></p>
<h4><a name="knockdown">Knocking down the bad guy with a shot to the hand</a></h4>
<p>This table also illustrates the fallacy of movie lore of a man being shot 
(particularly in an extremity) and falling down from the impact. The energy in a 
.357 Magnum handgun round ( a fairly high power example) is only about twice 
that in a fastball at 100 mi/hr. You can get hit by a baseball (particularly in 
the hand) and not be knocked down (although it will hurt a bunch), and likewise, 
you can get hit by a bullet and not get knocked down (although it will hurt a 
whole lot more). The FBI did a study on this a few years back and concluded that 
in most cases, the victim falls down because they are surprised or because they 
think, subconsciously, that they should fall down when shot. When the victim 
doesn't feel the pain (i.e. they're drunk, drugged, or very motivated), they 
don't fall down! I leave aside here the question of injuring someone in a vital 
area and killing them, which will make them fall down, whether by baseball, 
bullet, or fast moving hand.</p>
<p>Also notice that the rifle bullet or football tackle, with energies of 
several kJ, will knock you down.</p>
