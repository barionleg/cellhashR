<title>General Cathode Ray Tube Results</title>
</head>

<h2>General Cathode Ray Tube Results </h2>
<p>There were a number of results gathered over the years by cathode ray tube 
researchers.</p>
<p>1) If an object is placed in the path of the cathode ray, a shadow of the 
object is cast on the glowing tube wall at the end. This showed that the cathode 
rays traveled in straight lines.</p>
<p>2) The cathode ray can push a small paddle wheel up an incline, against the 
force of gravity. This showed that the cathode ray carried energy and could do 
work.</p>
<p>3) The cathode ray is deflected from a straight line path by a magnetic 
field, suggesting that the two were related in some way. The discovery of this 
effect in 1855 predates by some ten years the unification of electricity and 
magnetism by James Clerk Maxwell.</p>
<p>4) Although there was some speculation that the cathode rays were negatively 
charged, it is not shown to be true by experiment until 1895, just two years 
before Thomson announces the electron.</p>
<p>5) J.J. Thomson is the first individual to succeed in deflecting the cathode 
ray with an electrical field. He did so in 1897. The cathode rays bend toward 
the positive pole, confirming that cathode rays is negatively charged.</p>
